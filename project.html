    <h2>Project Details</h2>

    <p>
        Aim of this project is to create a smart floating robot that removes waste from the surface of water without help of any human. 
        It uses a Raspberry Pi 5 for control and is powered by rechargeable batteries charged through solar panels, so that it can function for 
        extended periods of time without requiring frequent recharge.A camera, along with a Faster RCNN based object detection system, allows 
        the robot to detect trash in real time. Two small DC motors with propellers help the boat to move. When debris is detected, a
        conveyor gently lifts the waste and deposits it into a container on the robot. The design is simple and cost-effective while remaining efficient, 
        making it an ideal choice for cleaning lakes, ponds, and other stagnant water areas. This robot is designed to safeguard marine life and 
        promote a cleaner,more sustainable ecosystem.

    <ul style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.8; margin-top:20px;">
        <h3>🔹 AI-Based Trash Detection</h3>
        <p>Uses a Faster R-CNN deep-learning model to detect plastic bottles, paper, metal waste, and floating debris with high accuracy.</p>
        <h3>🔹 Real-Time Decision Making</h3>
        <p>The onboard Raspberry Pi 5 processes camera inputs and sensor feedback instantly for trash detection and movement control.</p>
        <h3>🔹 Autonomous Navigation</h3>
        <p>Dual propeller motors controlled by a Raspberry Pi enable smooth and independent movement across water bodies.</p>
        <h3>🔹 Obstacle Avoidance System</h3>
        <p>An ultrasonic sensor continuously scans the surroundings and prevents collisions through intelligent route adjustments.</p>
        <h3>🔹 Motorized Conveyor Collection</h3>
        <p>A compact, belt-driven conveyor system automatically collects waste into a storage bin when debris is detected.</p>
        <h3>🔹 Solar-Powered Operation</h3>
        <p>Equipped with a solar panel and Li-ion batteries for extended run-time, reduced manual charging, and eco-friendly operation.</p>
